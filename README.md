Purposals:
This project is mainly to use the data analysis technology to count the total births in US from 1880 to 2010. To explain it in detail, by analyzing the birth data from 1880 to 2010, we can know the total birth number of male and female from 1880 to 2010. And also, we can get the naming trends of specific names like John, Harry, Mary and so on. What's more, we can measure the increase in naming diversity by counting the proportion of some popular names in all names. 

TODO:
Make sure the goal of the analysis; 
Get the original data and pre-dispose the data.; 
Data cleaning (Exclude outliers, blank values, invalid values, duplicate values); 
Data sorting (base on the aim of the analysis); 
Use the results to draw the picture.
