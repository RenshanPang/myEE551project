This is my EE551 python individual project |Author: Renshan Pang

1. Translator between Chinese and English
Purposals:
This code is mainly to use the Web crawler Technology and the tkinter package to form an application, which can translate the messages between Chinese and English and clear the writing table. The website I used is https://fanyi.baidu.com/, which is a Chinese translation website. The translating task actually is done by this website. What the application to do is to imitate the access proccess.

TODO:

1.Analyze the structure of the translation website
2.Design the translation method
3.Design clear method
4.Design the interface of the application

2. Student Check-In
Purposals:
This code is mainly to use the flask packages to complete the student check-in application. The main idea is that, firstly, we should write the html website including the QR code of the information inputting website. We can use this https://cli.im/url website to generate the QR code for the information inputting website. At this website, we need to get the student check-in information, which includes name, sex, studentID and date. After getting the student information, we need to generate one excel form to log these information. The third website is to show the check-in successful message.

TODO:
1. Figure out the way to use flask package
2. Write the three html websites
3. Saving the student check-in information and forming the excel table
